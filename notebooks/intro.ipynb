    "# Adversarial ML\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of adversarial examples for neural networks has been first observed in the context of image classification [[Szegedy et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199)]. There are many great review papers on adversarial attacks and corresponding defenses. For example, the following publications are open access: [[Ren et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2019.12.012); [Khamaiseh et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3208131); [Meyers et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-023-10521-4); [Liu et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-024-10841-z)]."

    "## Adversarial attacks\n",

    "We consider image classification as a prototypical problem for the occurrence of adversarial inputs. Given a dataset $\\{(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$ of images $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ and labels $y_i$. The weights $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ of a neural network $\\mathcal{M}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ can be found by minimizing a loss function:\n",

    "Here, $L(\\mathcal{M}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}), y)$ is the contribution of a single data point $(\\boldsymbol{x}, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a trained classifier, one can try to (imperceptibly) perturb an input $\\boldsymbol{x}$ such the altered image $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{x}} \\in \\mathcal{B}_p(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\epsilon)$ is misclassified. A small $\\ell_p$-ball $\\mathcal{B}_p(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\epsilon) = \\{\\boldsymbol{x}^\\star \\colon \\lVert \\boldsymbol{x}^\\star -\\boldsymbol{x} \\rVert_p \\leq \\epsilon\\}$ with radius $\\epsilon > 0$ is often used to constrain the image modification.

    "\n",
    "Since the predicted probability of the true class is minimized, without specifying a certain wrong target class, the attack above is called **untargeted**.

    "## Adversarial training\n",

    "Many defenses against adversarial attacks have been proposed in the literature.
